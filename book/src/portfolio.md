## Description

We do not stop playing because we grow old; we grow old because we stop playing. I am always thinking—thinking about the origin of humanity, the paradoxes of dimensions, the destination of the Coulomb force.

And yet I am deeply aware of the sorrow of being a low-dimensional being.

In the eyes of higher-dimensional life, I am nothing more than an elongated creature with length, width, height, and time. If all I thought about each day were what to eat for my next meal, what to wear tomorrow, or when my work was due, I would probably live quite happily.

But I simply cannot stop thinking—cannot stop, even in death.
